Let other developers customize your package model and migrations.

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Laragear\MetaModel\CustomMigration;
use Laragear\MetaModel\HasCustomization;

class MyPackageModel extends Model
{
    use HasCustomization;
    
    protected static function migration(): string
    {
        return new CustomMigration(function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->string('title');
            $table->timestamps();
        })
    }
}
```

## Keep this package free

[![](.github/assets/support.png)](https://github.com/sponsors/DarkGhostHunter)

Your support allows me to keep this package free, up-to-date and maintainable. Alternatively, you can **[spread the word!](http://twitter.com/share?text=I%20am%20using%20this%20cool%20PHP%20package&url=https://github.com%2FLaragear%2FMetaModel&hashtags=PHP,Laravel)**

## Requirements

- Laravel 11 or later

## Installation

Fire up Composer and require it into your package:

```bash
composer require laragear/meta-model
```

## Customizing models

When you create a model in your package, most of the time, your end-developers won't be able to modify it unless they create a repository that manually creates a model. Instead, you can add the `HasCustomization` trait to your model and let the developer modify the model when is instanced.


```php
namespace Vendor\Package\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Laragear\MetaModel\HasCustomization;
use Vendor\Package\Migrations\CarMigration;

class Car extends Model
{
    use HasCustomization;
    
    // ...
}
```

> [!TIP]
> 
> The trait is marked as "internal" to avoid appearing on your IDE.

From there, the end-developer can customize the model by setting a callback to the `customize()` method, that receives the model instance. For example, you may do this in your `bootstrap/app.php` through the `booted()` method.

```php
use Vendor\Package\Models\PackageModel;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Application;

return Application::booted(function () {

    PackageModel::customize(function ($model) {
        $model->setTable('my_custom_table');
        $model->setConnection('read-database');
    });
    
})->create();
```

## Custom Migration

You may use the `migration()` method of the trait to create a hands-off migration that can only be extended. This is a great way to let the developer with an immutable table, but allow them to add columns or change the primary model type for.

The `Laragear\MetaModel\CustomMigration` class can be created using the `create()` method. It receives a callback that will be used to create the table. The table name is retrieved automatically from the Model, and it will be automatically dropped when invoking `down()`.

```php
namespace MyVendor\MyPackage\Models;

use Closure;use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Laragear\MetaModel\CustomMigration;
use Laragear\MetaModel\HasCustomization;
use MyVendor\MyPackage\Models\Car;

class Car extends Model
{
    use HasCustomization;
    
    public static function migration(): CustomMigration
    {
        return new CustomMigration(function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->string('title');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }
}
```

> [!TIP]
> 
> The callback `$this` is bound to the `CustomMigration` instance, not the model.

Once then, we can create the migration file `0000_00_00_000000_create_cars_table.php`. Instead of returning a class that extends the default Laravel migration, we use our model and the `migration()` method.

```php
// database/migrations/0000_00_00_000000_create_cars_table.php

use MyVendor\MyPackage\Models\Car;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;

return Car::migration();
```

### Morphs

> [!CAUTION]
> 
> Morphs are only supported for a single relation. Multiple morphs relations on a single table is highly discouraged. 

If your migration requires morph relationships, you will find that end-developers won't always have the same key type in their application to associate with. This problem can be fixed by using the `createMorph()` or `createNullableMorph()` method with the `Blueprint` instance and the name of the morph type.

```php
use Laragear\MetaModel\CustomMigration;

public static function migration(): CustomMigration
{
    return new CustomMigration(function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->id();
        
        $this->createMorph($table, 'ownable');
        
        $table->string('manufacturer');
        $table->string('model');
        $table->tinyInteger('year');
        
        $table->timestamps();
    });
}
```

This will let the end-developer to change the morph type through the `morph()` method if needed. For example, if he's using ULID morphs for the target models, he may set it in one line:

```php
use MyVendor\MyPackage\Models\Car;

return Car::migration()->morph('ulid', 'custom_index_name');
```

#### Default index name

You may also set a custom index name for the morph. It will be used as a default, unless the user overrides it manually.

```php
use Laragear\MetaModel\CustomMigration;

public static function migration(): CustomMigration
{
    return new CustomMigration(function (Blueprint $table) {
        // ...
        
        $this->createMorphRelation($table, 'ownable', 'ownable_table_index');
    }
}
```

```php
use MyVendor\MyPackage\Models\Car;

// Uses "custom_index_name" as index name
return Car::migration()->morph('ulid', 'custom_index_name');

// Uses "ownable_table_index" as index name
return Car::migration()->morph('ulid');
``` 

### After Up & Before Down

An end-developer can execute logic after the table is created, and before the table is dropped, using the `afterUp()` and `beforeDown()` methods, respectively. This allows the developer to run enhance the table, or avoid failing migrations.

For example, the end-developer can use these methods to create foreign column references, and remove them before dropping the table.

```php
use MyVendor\MyPackage\Models\Car;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;

return Car::migration()
    ->afterUp(function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->foreign('manufacturer')->references('name')->on('manufacturers');
    })
    ->beforeDown(function (Blueprint $table) {
         $table->dropForeign('manufacturer');
    });
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> The `afterUp()` and `beforeDown()` adds callbacks to the migration, it doesn't replace them.

## Package documentation

If you plan to add this to your package, you may also want to copy-and-paste the [DATABASE.md](DATABASE.md) file in your package. This way developers will know how to use your model and migrations. Alternatively, you may also just copy its contents, or link back to this repository.

You may execute this from your project root:

```shell
cp vendor/laragear/meta-model/DATABASE.md ./DATABASE.md
```

## Laravel Octane compatibility

- There are no singletons using a stale application instance.
- There are no singletons using a stale config instance.
- There are no singletons using a stale request instance.
- Trait static properties are only written once by end-developer.

There should be no problems using this package with Laravel Octane.
